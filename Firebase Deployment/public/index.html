    <h2>It's not OVER until You WIN! Your Dream is Possible</h2>
    <p>Setting goals is the first step for turning the invisible into the visible. <br />
        Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifices and most of all,
    <b>love of what you are doing or learning to do.</b> </p>
    <h2>Never Give up</h2>
    <p> <em>Stay true to yourself</em>, yet always be open to learning. Work hard and never give up on your dreams,
        even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you
        need; no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.</p>
    <h3>With hard work and effort, you can achieve anything.</h3>
    <h4>With hard work and dedication, anything is possible.</h4>
    <h5>A lot of hard work is hidden behind nice things.</h5>
    <h6>Through hard work, perseverance and faith in God, you can live your dreams.</h6>
